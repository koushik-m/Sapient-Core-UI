dont write the code 
prepare the unit test
create the function and leave it


before each in jasmine
        - this will execute for every test case;
        - we will set required artifacts for the unit test.
mocks in jasmine
        - they are the dummy functions which really dont have any code, but acts as a real function
        - we can create a mock and then we will return the data from the mock.
        - they are helpful in simulating the behaviour of dummy servers, dummy http calls    


FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN
    - provide just interface. depending on input subclasses will decide what needs to be created
    - very widely used in modern softwares.
    - 
MODULE DESIGN PATTERN
    - all the methods will be kept private and you only expose those methods in the end to the client
